# Predicting Movie Ratings and Analyzing Feature Importance Using Tags and Genres: Insights from the MovieLens 32M Dataset

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between movie characteristics (genres and user-generated tags) and user ratings using the MovieLens 32M dataset. It leverages a hybrid deep learning model combining attention mechanisms with a wide-deep architecture to predict movie ratings. The model demonstrates exceptional accuracy and provides insights into feature importance through SHAP values, offering valuable implications for content recommendation systems.

## Features
- Predictive model for movie ratings using genres and user-generated tags.
- SHAP value analysis to identify the most influential genres and tags.
- Exceptional performance, achieving a validation MAE of 0.091.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Pyplot and Seaborn for data visualization
- Gensim for Word2Vec embeddings
- TensorFlow/Keras for modeling
- SHAP for feature importance analysis

## Setup
1. Download the Python notebook named "Project_v1.ipynb"
2. Download the MovieLens 32M dataset from [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/32m/) and place it in the specified directory.
3. Execute the notebook on a GPU-enabled environment.
